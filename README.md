# RiskBoardGame

Tag the project as “final”
Increase the line coverage of the test cases to at least 80% 
Refactor, refactor, refactor: Ask yourself:  can you implement classes with fewer fields? Can the number of method arguments be smaller? Have you designed any Exception specific to your project (e.g. InvalidMoveExeption)?
